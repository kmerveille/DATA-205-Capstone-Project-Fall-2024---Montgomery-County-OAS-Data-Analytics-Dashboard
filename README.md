# DATA-205-Capstone-Project-Fall-2024---Montgomery-County-OAS-Data-Analytics-Dashboard
The Montgomery County Office of Animal Services (OAS) handles the impounding and fostering of animals throughout the county. With a large amount of data being generated, there is a need to develop an efficient and actionable analytics dashboard to monitor animal impounds, foster placements, and their outcomes. This project leverages historical data from OAS to create a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into the operational trends and key metrics related to animal services.
